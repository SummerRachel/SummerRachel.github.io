### Welcome
Hello, I am Rachel Xia. This is my public github repository.
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Edinburgh - Zhejiang University Institute. 
I made some changes to this page and I hope it will work.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SummerRachel/SummerRachel.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SummerRachel/SummerRachel.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
